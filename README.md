<h2 align="right">chinese-buildings</h2>

Chinese buildings has attracted so many people around the world including hand painters from French. There was a book , named <**Essai sur l'architecture chinoise** (中國建築彩繪筆記·工具與樣式)>, has arisen during 1800s, the author of which is still a secret, as it was almost 300 years since now. It has collected some hand paintings around Chinese buildings, and I hope to use this project to sort out all those paints into an archive with specific categories. At the same time, I am also going to translate them into English so that we can clearly know about them without knowing french.

Here we know:

- [**The City Walls (城墻)**](./wall/wall.md)
- **The Screen Walls (照壁)**
- **The Cabinets (閣樓)**
- **The Bridges (游橋)**
- **The Towers (塔)**
- **The Houses (房)**
- **The Interiors (内室)**
